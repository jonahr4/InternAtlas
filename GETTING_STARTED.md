# Getting Started

This guide sets up the workspace locally with minimal steps.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS)
- npm
- Docker Desktop (for Postgres later)

## Setup
1) Install Docker Desktop (needed for local Postgres):
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

2) Install dependencies:
```bash
cd app
npm install
```

3) Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4) Open the app:
- http://localhost:3000

## Next Step
Continue with Phase 1 in `TODO.md` once the app runs.
